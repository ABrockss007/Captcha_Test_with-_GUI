# Audio-Captcha
this is a Audio captcha GUI implementation 
Basically in this implementation I have taken a string which is a random 4 digit number with the help of random library
then with the help of pyttsx3 library we can convert the string to audio with the help of voice function.
and hence when the input is given we check the input with the given string 
i have added more functions like regenerate the audio as well .
Also this project miight not work on MAC devices!
